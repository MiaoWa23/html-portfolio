<h1>The best movie accordind to Suphawadi</h1>
<h2>My top three anime of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>hunter x hunter</h3>
<p> Hunter x Hunter is considered one of the best shonen manga 
    and anime series in history. However, due to severe health 
    complications, Togashi had to take long breaks and put 
    Hunter x Hunter on hold. As of 04 Nov 2023, there is no 
    information on when Hunter x Hunter will come back.</p>
<h3>natsume's book of friends</h3>
<p>It is good, I watched all seasons. It is relatively calm, 
    occasionally dark, but without going overboard about it. 
    There are no hysterical protagonists, no cliche cackling 
    villains, no dismemberment for the sake of shock value, 
    no people screaming out obvious moral values, and it doesnâ€™t 
    heavily rely on standard anime stereotypes (no obligatory 
    ojousama twintail blond loli tsundere in limousine, no rei 
    ayanami clones, no moe stereotypes here). No fanservice either.
    It does get very sad occasionally.</p>
<h3>one piece</h3>
<p>The storyline while watching anime is common to viewers. As 
    for One Piece, it left many viewers clueless even with plenty 
    of foreshadow scenes, promoting the fans' anime thirst. Well, 
    the way of presenting the essential pieces of the plotline is 
    presented strategically and entertaining.</p>
